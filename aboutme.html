                        &bull; I make random bots whenever i have an idea (which is quite rare nowadays)<br><br>
                        &bull; I modify the greetings i created for my bots with AI. I wanted to make the greetings feel novel-like,
                        but i kinda suck at it so i rely on AI to make the greetings i created longer and just edit it a bit to my liking.<br><br>
                        &bull; If you were to possibly dm me on tiktok to request a bot created..
                        Please note that it'll be a 50/50 chance that i'll create it.<br><br>
                        &bull; Theres a chance that i'll just leave your message on read if you ever dm me.
                        (Please dont think of it's rude, i usually get nervous and dont know what to say so i ended up just leaving it like that.)
